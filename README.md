# PFun.-Project
Draughts or checkers is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. Draughts developed from alquerque. My team made a python program for 8 by 8, 6 by 6 and 4 by 4 board as a Habib University's Fall 2020 Programmming Fundamentals course's project.
